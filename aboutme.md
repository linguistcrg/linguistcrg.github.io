<br>I’m a second-year student of the Research MA in Computational Linguistics at <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en">Utrecht University</a>, 
with an interest in the intersection of AI and Linguistics. I am also an AI & Data Science Intern at 
<a href="https://www.tno.nl/en/about-tno/organisation/units/information-communication-technology/data-science/">TNO</a> and Data Engineering 
Research Assistant for the <a href="https://cdh.uu.nl">Centre for Digital Humanities</a> at Utrecht University.<br><br>

In the past, I have worked as Data Analysis Research Assistant for <a href="https://www.clariah.nl">CLARIAH</a> and the 
<a href="https://sites.bu.edu/pamlab/">PAMLab</a> at Boston University, during my stay as a <a href="https://fulbrightscholars.org">Fulbright scholar</a>. 
My main areas of interest are: Natural Language Processing, Generative AI, Conversational AI and Machine Learning.<br><br>

When I’m not working, I like to read, travel, play videogames, and do Pilates.<br>

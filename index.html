<p>I’m an AI Engineer at <a href="https://www.rabobank.nl/">Rabobank</a>, with an interest in the intersection of AI and Linguistics. I earned a Research MA in Computational Linguistics at <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en">Utrecht University</a> in 2024.</p>

<p>In the past, I was an AI & Data Science Intern at 
<a href="https://www.tno.nl/en/about-tno/organisation/units/information-communication-technology/data-science/">TNO</a> and Data Engineering Research Assistant for the <a href="https://cdh.uu.nl">Centre for Digital Humanities</a> at Utrecht University. I have also worked as Data Analysis Research Assistant for <a href="https://www.clariah.nl">CLARIAH</a> and the <a href="https://sites.bu.edu/pamlab/">PAMLab</a> at Boston University, during my stay as a <a href="https://fulbrightscholars.org">Fulbright scholar</a>. My main areas of interest are: Natural Language Processing, Generative AI, Conversational AI and Machine Learning.</p>

<p>When I’m not working, I like to read, travel, play videogames, and do Pilates.</p>
